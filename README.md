# Hollywood-VFX-movies-Analysis (SQL+Python)
 Should studios continue to invest heavily in VFX movies, or do non-VFX films yield better financial returns?
Used dataset tmbd_5000_movies from Kaggle and transformed it into the Hollymovies dataset, where I created VFX Flag, tagged movies as VFX-heavy if the genre contains Action, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Adventure in SQL.
Did analysis in both SQL and Python, also did Visualization on Python.
